# ProFitApp 

# What are I'm trying to solve

Let's face it: every man and woman wants to know if he or she can lose weight by going to the gym. 
And they want to know how to calculate their body fat percentage. The good news is that a body fat calculator is a useful tool that also allows you to discover their ideal weight, the number of calories you need to consume a day for a healthy weight, and more.

# Who will interact with the App

 Anyone that wants to improve on their health. In the future fitness trainers and gym, owners would encourage their members and 
 clients to use the app.  

# Core functionality

 Body composition calculator
  -BMI
  -Body fat percentage
  -Daily calories needed to lose or gain weight 
 Daily meal plan
 -Generate 3 daily meals that fit within the recommended calories for weight loss or weight gain. 
  

# Future enhancements
 I'm working on adding cardio/strength training tracking in the near future. 
 I also would like to have the app connect to fitness tracking wearables like apple-health, Fitbit, and Garmin.
